name: Mama's Cornbread Dressing
source: Wilma Snow c/o Julie

ingredients:
  - (3/4 cup) cornbread crumbs
  - (1/4 cup) white bread crumbs
  - (2 cup) chopped celery
  - (1 cup) chopped onion
  - (3) egg, beaten
  - (1 tbsp) sage
  - (1 quart) chicken broth (and some extra)
  - salt
  - pepper

directions:
  - Preheat oven to 350F.
  - Saute celery and onion in oil or butter.
  - Combine bread crumbs and sage. Add salt and pepper to taste. Stir in beaten
    egg and chicken broth until mixture is soupy.
  - Bake in a buttered casserole dish or lasagna pan until set (about 30-40
    minutes). Be sure the dressing has browned a little on top. You can
    increase the temperature to 400F near the end to help with this. You may
    wish to stir the dressing after it begins to "set up".

notes: |
  You can double this dish and prepare as is, or you may wish to add cooked and
  chopped chicken to one or both dishes before cooking.

  Any cornbread recipe will do, though you should use one which has buttermilk
  in it. Most sandwich varieties of white bread are sufficient, you just want
  to avoid dry varieties like French bread (think Italian white bread). White
  hamburger buns also work well.
